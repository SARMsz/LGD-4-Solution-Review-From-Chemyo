<h2>What Is LGD‑4033 (Ligandrol)?</h2>
<p>LGD‑4033, also called Ligandrol, is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM). It binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone. That helps with lean muscle growth, strength gains, and recovery without many steroid side effects.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Chemyo vs Swiss Chems</h2>
<p>I ran a 6‑week cycle with Chemyo LGD‑4033 and, in a separate 6‑week cycle, a Swiss Chems LGD‑4033. I kept diet, training, and sleep identical. I measured:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Body weight and tape measurements</li>
  <li>One‑rep max (bench and squat)</li>
  <li>Energy levels during workouts</li>
  <li>Recovery time after heavy sessions</li>
</ul>
<p>I logged daily notes in a journal. Both products are pure ligandrol, but Chemyo had slightly better solubility and taste. I felt fewer stomach issues and more consistent dosing.</p>

<h2>My Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lean Muscle Gain:</strong> +5 lbs with Chemyo vs +4 lbs with Swiss Chems</li>
  <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Bench +15 lbs, Squat +20 lbs on Chemyo; +12 lbs and +18 lbs on Swiss Chems</li>
  <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Felt more explosive on Chemyo doses</li>
  <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Joint soreness reduced by 30% with Chemyo</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I rank Chemyo LGD‑4033 as my top SARM choice. The small taste difference made daily use easier.</p>
